# doubly-linked-list
this file will have the following methods:
1. insert_end - which will insert the new node at the end 
2. insert_start - which will insert at the starting of the linked list
3. insert_at - which will insert at the given index
4. show - to print the nodes of linked list
in doubly linked list we will have to manage two links of the current node one to the previous node and other to the next node
